## Purpose

Contained within this repository are commands, definitions and quick references to things that I use regularly enough to make notes about, but consistently forget how to use. 

## Contributing

This repository is not designed to be for everyone, because it's very specific to what I find useful, however, if you do find something incorrect MR's are welcome.
